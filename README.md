# Project for Machine Learning (CSCE 5063 -- Spring 2018)

This course focused on neural networks, and my project for the course was to use Java to build a machine learning package that implemented neural networks in various ways.   The course professor, Dr. Michael Gashler (University of Arkansas), provided me with some starting code that included matrix and vector functions, but I was responsible for implementing linear, nonlinear, and convolutional layers; backpropagation; stochastic and batch gradient descent; momentum; and cross validation.  Assignments included using neural networks for time series prediction and inference.
